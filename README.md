This project was based on exercise 1 of the course "HTML" in "Fundamentos" of the Fullstack Javascript learning track by OneBitCode.
The objective of the original exercise was to create a simple html only page using the basic elements.
The full project now includes:
- Navigation to different sections of the page;
- Restructuring of the page (using semantic elements);
- General styling of the page with CSS.
